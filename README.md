👋 Hello, I'm Samil Jahan
Cybersecurity Student at Swinburne University
Focused on Network Security • Vulnerability Assessment • Threat Detection

I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Science (Cyber Security major) at Swinburne University, driven by a strong passion for securing digital environments. My journey started with curiosity about how software and networks work, and evolved into a specialized path in cyber defense.

With hands-on experience in project management, incident response, and vulnerability assessments, I bridge academic theory with real-world cybersecurity practice. I work confidently across Linux systems, Active Directory domains, and cloud environments, and regularly engage in ethical hacking labs and system hardening exercises.

🎯 Objective
To contribute to a Security Operations Center (SOC) team as a Tier 1 Analyst, leveraging my skills in monitoring, automation, and vulnerability management to detect and mitigate cyber threats efficiently.

🔬 Featured Projects
1. Detection Lab – Brute Force Detection + SIEM Correlation
Built a home lab to simulate brute-force RDP attacks using Kali Linux and Crowbar. Collected telemetry with Splunk and analyzed failed login patterns to generate alerts. Integrated Atomic Red Team for adversary emulation.

2. SOC Automation Project – TheHive, Shuffle, Cortex
Designed a working SOC workflow using open-source tools. Automated incident ingestion and enrichment with Cortex analyzers, integrated case management with TheHive, and executed playbooks via Shuffle SOAR.

3. SafeLine WAF Evaluation
Tested SafeLine Web Application Firewall across simulated web services. Configured rule sets, monitored block/allow logs, and identified gaps in default signature coverage. Conducted manual input fuzzing and SQLi tests.

4. Active Directory + Group Policy Management
Configured a Windows Server Domain Controller in a home lab. Set up OUs, group strategies, password policies, login scripts, and firewall rules using GPO to enforce organizational compliance.
